# Line_Follower
The main objective for this final project was to program a Pololu 3pi Robot to perform navigational tasks on a simulated delivery route based on user-provided inputs prior to the robotâ€™s departure. This two-wheeled, line-following mobile robot was  controlled using a state machine program with closed-loop control, specifically using PID gains, on the AVR platform. The primary idea is for the robot to follow a dark line on a light background and correct itself using integrated reflectance sensors as part of the closed loop control system. The PID control was integrated into a state transition diagram where the states were logic-driven with the sensors and high or low values from push buttons as inputs and different functions as outputs.
